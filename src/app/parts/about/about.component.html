            Hello! I'm Benjamin (Ben), a Seattle based software engineer with a love for
            spaceflight and cutting-edge technology. What drives and motivates me at this
            stage of my career is my desire is to grow my technological skills and gain the
            experience and self-assurance needed to meet unforeseen industry
            challenges and achieve project success via innovation in the deployment of
            next generation solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            I consider myself to be inventive, forward thinking, trustworthy, keenly
            focused, and consistently capable of implementing creative and elegant
            solutions to complex problems via collaboration, big picture thinking and agile
            methodologies. In addition, my time at PopOver and the University of Puget
            Sound provided opportunities for me to demonstrate my ability to design,
            develop, and maintain software, quickly learn new skills, and successfully and
            ethically work within teams, as member and as leader.
        </p>

        <p>
            After graduating from the <a href="{{ups_link}}" target="_blank">University of Puget Sound</a>, I joined
            PopOver, a
            startup led by a fellow Puget Sound graduate, where I contributed to
            brainstorming, developing, and documenting our original protype build that
            ultimately led to the deployment and testing of the application. This
            experience helped me to sharpen my problem-solving skills and to gain a
            better functional understanding of full-stack development and the Systems
            Engineering product life cycle. Since the <a href="{{covid_link}}" target="_blank">COVID-19</a> pandemic I
            have been keeping my software developing
            skills honed while I find my next adventure.
