        <p>
            I'm Benjamin (Ben), a Seattle-based software engineer with a love for spaceflight and cutting-edge
            technologies. What motivates me is my desire to enhance my personal technology skills and gain the expertise
            necessary to confront current and evolving aerospace industry challenges. I look forward to playing key
            roles in transformative project success via software innovation and the deployment of next-generation
            solutions and breakthrough applications.
        </p>

            Iâ€™m forward-thinking, trustworthy, and have solid experience implementing creative solutions to complex
            problems via constructive interaction, collaboration, and the use of Agile Methodology. My work to date has
            provided me with opportunities to demonstrate my ability to design, develop, and maintain software, quickly
            learn new skills, and successfully and ethically work within teams, both as a member and as a leader.
        </p>

        <p>
            After graduating from the <a href="{{ups_link}}" target="_blank">University of Puget Sound</a>, I joined
            PopOver, a local startup where I participated in brainstorming, developing, and documenting a prototype
            build that ultimately led to the deployment and testing of the launch application. This experience sharpened
            my problem-solving skills and provided a functional understanding of full-stack development and the Systems
            Engineering product life cycle. Since the start of the <a href="{{covid_link}}" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>
            pandemic, I have been keeping my software development skills honed while seeking out my next adventure.
